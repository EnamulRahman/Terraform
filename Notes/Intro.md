🚀 Completed Terraform AWS Module!

After weeks of learning, debugging, and hands-on practice, I’m thrilled to have completed the Terraform AWS module and successfully deployed real infrastructure on AWS! 💻☁️

Here’s what I accomplished:

✅ Assignment 1: Deploy WordPress using Terraform

EC2 instance running WordPress

Security groups and public endpoints

Automated installation with user_data / cloud-init

Learned to troubleshoot ALB health checks and fix issues (2.5 hours of debugging turned out to be a simple fix 😅)

✅ Assignment 2: EC2 Deployment with Cloud-Init

Created a cloud-init YAML to automatically configure EC2

Installed NGINX, created a custom webpage, and started services on first boot

Fully automated workflow with Terraform variables, outputs, and proper tagging

Deployed in eu-west-2 with a custom VPC, subnet, IGW, and route tables

💡 Key Takeaways:

Terraform is powerful for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Cloud-init allows zero-touch instance configuration

Debugging and perseverance are critical — sometimes the smallest issue (like missing a subnet or a tag conflict) can block deployment

Structuring Terraform with variables, outputs, and modules makes your infrastructure reusable and maintainable

🌐 Seeing my EC2 instances come alive, fully configured with web servers, and accessible via public URLs was incredibly satisfying. This project strengthened my AWS, Terraform, and automation skills massively.

If you’re learning Terraform, stick with it! The learning curve is worth it — nothing beats seeing real infrastructure deployed automatically.
